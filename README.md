This project is a 2D artillery game developed using Python and the Kivy framework. The game features three themed levels (The Simpsons, Futurama, SpongeBob) where the player controls a tank, aiming to hit a target. 
The design progressively introduces new mechanics, including dynamic obstacles, mirror-based laser reflections, and wormhole teleportation. 
The player has a choice of three weapons: a bullet, a bomb, and a laser. 
Key development goals included a modular screen/widget architecture, a stable 60 FPS update loop, and clear audio/visual feedback.
